# LLM Workflow

## Overview
This project compares three different approaches to processing and repurposing content using Large Language Models (LLMs):
1. **Pipeline Workflow** â€“ Sequential execution of tasks.
2. **DAG Workflow with Reflexion** â€“ Tasks are structured as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with self-correction.
3. **Agent-Driven Workflow** â€“ An autonomous agent iterates through the workflow, selecting tools dynamically.

## Setup Instructions
### **1. Clone the Repository**
```sh
 git clone https://github.com/your-repo/llm-workflow.git
 cd llm-workflow
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then, install required packages:
```sh
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3. Run the Workflow**
To execute the workflow and evaluate the approaches, run:
```sh
 python llm_workflow.py
```

## ðŸ“– Implementation Details
### **Workflow Components:**
- **Extract Key Points:** Identifies main takeaways from the content.
- **Generate Summary:** Produces a concise summary.
- **Create Social Media Posts:** Generates Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook posts.
- **Create Email Newsletter:** Composes a newsletter.

### **Workflow Approaches:**
1. **Pipeline Workflow:** Runs tasks sequentially.
2. **DAG Workflow:** Uses Reflexion to refine outputs dynamically.
3. **Agent-Driven Workflow:** Uses an agent to determine and execute tasks iteratively.

## Effectiveness Analysis
| Approach   | Coherence | Relevance | Completeness | Execution Time |
|------------|-----------|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| **Pipeline** | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 2.88 sec |
| **DAG** | 0.97 | 0.60 | 1.00 | 2.86 sec |
| **Agent** | 0.18 | 0.16 | 0.50 | 3.17 sec |

### **Observations:**
- **Pipeline Workflow**: Consistently high coherence, relevance, and completeness, but lacks adaptability.
- **DAG Workflow**: Provides structured execution with self-correction but is slightly less relevant.
- **Agent Workflow**: Flexible but performed inconsistently, needing improvements in decision-making.

## Challenges & Solutions
| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Agent workflow sometimes repeated tasks unnecessarily. | Limited iterations and refined prompt guidance. |
| DAG workflow had occasional irrelevant outputs. | Improved Reflexion logic to discard incorrect refinements. |
| Execution times varied across runs. | Optimized function calls to reduce redundancy. |

## Conclusion
- **Pipeline** is reliable but lacks adaptability.
- **DAG** improves accuracy with self-correction.
- **Agent** is promising but needs better reasoning.

**Future Work:** Enhance the agentâ€™s reasoning capabilities and improve execution efficiency.
